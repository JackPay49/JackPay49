I am an enthusiastic, driven and creative self-starter. I pride myself on my organisation, communication and public-speaking skills. I am primarily interested in Machine Learning and Computer vision, and would love to follow a career in this area whilst providing a positive contribution to society.

At the moment, I am a third year student at the University of Manchester, studying a Computer Science Bachelor's Degree. My dissertation is based around using Computer Vision & ML for lip reading. I am researching which methods and data will produce the best model, capable of parsing sentences, in English, based off of a video stream.

In-between my second and third years at University I was fortunate enough to be offered a Machine Learning Internship at SeeChange. Within this role I trained multiple Deep Learning models, setup an automated data generation pipeline and made smart feature vector gallery Python software. My internship concluded with a presentation to the whole company, including senior management, where I explained the various models, pipelines and results I'd found.

I am currently looking for graduate roles to start in 2024.

In my free time I enjoy writing short stories, reading novels and leading roleplaying games.
