I am an enthusiastic, driven and creative self-starter. I pride myself on my organisation, communication and public-speaking skills. I am primarily interested in Machine Learning and Computer vision, and would love to follow a career in this area whilst providing a positive contribution to society.

I have just graduated from the University of Manchester where I studied a Bsc in Computer Science. During my time at UoM I took part in several team projects, carried out research into different Machine learning areas, and completed my dissertation surrounding Lip Reading using Deep Learning. A series of these projects are viewable across this page. Some highlights are the [NLU based team project](https://github.com/DennisKiselev/nlu-coursework) which looked at Natural Language Inference, research into [image classification models](https://github.com/JackPay49/Image-Classification), and my [third year project](https://github.com/JackPay49/3rd-Year-Project). 

In-between my second and third years at University I was fortunate enough to be offered a Machine Learning Internship at SeeChange. Within this role I trained multiple Deep Learning models, setup an automated data generation pipeline and made smart feature vector gallery Python software. My internship concluded with a presentation to the whole company, including senior management, where I explained the various models, pipelines and results I'd found.

In July 2024, I began work at [Re:Course AI](https://www.recourseai.com/), a Machine Learning start-up placed in Deansgate, Manchester.

In my free time I enjoy writing short stories, reading novels and leading roleplaying games.
